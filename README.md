                      History Mate Application Report
THE HISTORY MATE APP
Created by Olwethu Zondi, the History Mate application was named in-motivation of the application’s purpose which is to enable and give the user (students/leaners) a intuitive platform to relate themselves closer to history and the legacy that past historical figures and legends have left behind. The History Mate application was designed to represent  a beacon of historical relation for each user who encounters/uses it, History is one of the most important aspects that we as human beings hold on to as a remembrance of the legacy that others have left, and the History Mate application provides users with a much more upfront experience.

THE PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION
The application allows the users to enter their selective age on the interface and instantly generates a search through stored historical data and relates that age to that of the historical figure/person that passed away or died at that certain age. The application also provides the users with a brief information on that particular historical figure/person on there efforts and achievements in their lifetime.
The main purpose of the History Mate application is to provide “mainly” students and the youth as a whole with an educational experience of history left behind by legends, political leaders, superstars and celebrities that once walked this very Earth. This type of technology is an emblem that showcases the evolution of technology and the beauty of how this evolution embraces and acknowledges the legacy and the achievements that these people have left behind. The application also aims to provide a much more fun experience while also giving off an educative experience as well.



DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
The application’s design motive was mainly and strongly based on providing the user with an engaging “User Interface” that builds interest and also captivates the user as they enjoy the experience of “visiting the past” and enjoying their educational and fun experiences. Illustrations and history themed graphics have ben used to enhance the “history themed” experience for each and every user.
Our user interface (UI) has been designed in order to be intuitive for students and in also for it to be very easy for students and other users to use and comfortably interact with. Also areas of engagement have been clearly put in place and clearly labelled to ensure that the user does not struggle to navigate there way around the application.

INPUT AND OUTPUT TOGGLES/TOOLS
User interface consists of  tools/button that allows the user to navigate input and output areas to make the usage experience even better…
1.	“Enter Age” EditText: A designated area on the interface has been set fir the user to enter their selective age as “Input”. It has been designed and in a way that will be much easier for the user to find and utilize.

2.	“Search” Button: On completion after the user has inserted their age, a “Search” button has  been added to allow and command the application software to generate a search and compare/relate a historical figure to that of the user’s age.

3.	“Clear” Button: After the history has been generated and displayed a “Clear” button has been provided for the user to clear out everything from the user interface and enter a different age and continue to enjoy the educative experience.

 
 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE ON USAGE OF APPLICATION
Here is a brief step-by-step guide on how to use and navigate the application to make your utilisation super easy to use.
STEP 1
After successful installation of the History Mate application, view the user interface that will display which will consist of an “Enter Age” portal, a “Search” buton and a “Clear” button.
STEP 2
Click on the “Enter Age” area/portal and insert your selective age ranging between 20 to 100 years. (PLEASE NOTE: DUE TO ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTIONS THE ONLY AGES AVAILABLE ON THE APPLICATION ARE LIMITED TO 28,33,40,51,61,70,80,90,93,100)
STEP 3
After you have inserted your selective age proceed to click on the “Search’ button allow the application’s software to generate results/output.
STEP 4
Once loading  has been completed, the results/output will appear/display on the bottom of your screen.
STEP 5
Once you have read the generated results you may then click on the “Clear” button to clear the search and enter another selective age number to view more information and fun facts.






ERROR HANDLING AND UTILISATION OF GitHub AND GitHub ACTIONS

GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. This platform was used to maintain the version control of the History Mate application. During the process of creating the application some errors were found along the way. Errors mainly concerning the user interface, user input errors, output errors and also issues with layout constrains as the application was built and coded using the Android Studio platform in a constrain layout. The utilisationof the GitHub platform assisted in spotting and resolving these issues and errors found in the code.

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test and deployment pipeline. The GitHub Actions continuous platform was used to easily generate a “build.yml”  file for the History Mate application, and also utilised to create and configure workflows for the application.
The generating of the build.yml file on GitHub Actions was to specify the structure, the type and names for package contents. And also to create a workflow to guide the process automatically, issuing messages/notifications for users to complete tasks or triggering system actions with specific commands.
The History Mate application was also equipped with “errors handling software” that provides the user with the constructive feedback or a notification when the user enters an invalid age format or information, or when the age entered by the user is not found in the search (since there are selected age limits due to the assignment restrictions). The application is also coded with displays/notifications that help to access and have a great and productive experience of the application. The application was debugged of errors and tests were ran using the emulator on the Android Studio platform and although errors were there we managed to fix some of them in order to make the application functionable without any problems. The GitHub version control also assisted in making sure that the History Mate application will work not only on one device but for it to function on computers, portable computers, mobile devices, smart phones in the most functionable way possible. The History Mate application was coded using Kotlin as a programming language. As they say “there is always room for improvement” the source is publicly out there on the GitHub platform and developers and fellow “coders” are welcome to access the source code and provide insight on what and how they might consider would be an upgrade for the application.
